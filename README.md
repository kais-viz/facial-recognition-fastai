# Using the Facial Recognition Challenge Dataset with Fastai Library

## Context
Applying FastAi on Kaggle competition's dataset from the [Facial Expression Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge). 
This notebook was created based on lesson's [one](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1) and [two](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=2) of the fastai course.

## Dataset

To download the competition dataset, simply go to the [facial expression recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge) page on Kaggle and click on `download all`.
Then you should extract the contents in the same directory as this jupyter notebook file.

**To find out how to train, clean up and test your model, check out the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/kais-viz/facial-recognition-fastai/blob/master/Facial%20Recognition%20Competition%20Using%20FastAi.ipynb) in the repo.**
